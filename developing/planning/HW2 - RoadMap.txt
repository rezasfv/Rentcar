<!-- BEFORE STARTING -->

1. Ask to the professor if we should change the ER schema because is too simple or if we can go on to the HW2 without
	any changes.
2. Ask to the professor what are "filters" (missing in HW1).
3. Download Ajax.
4. Compleate the draft in Balsamiq.
5. Check if the file Docker works (already inside the code folder).
6. Check how we can modify the access to the database due to "bad to use the root postgresql user to connect to the
	database".
 
<!-- STYLE -->

1. Find templates for our project (Gabriella can do that).
2. See the useful websites for color gradient, fonts and icons (links in "Lesson 6" of tutorship).

	-> everything can be upload it inside the folder "../developing/HTML style"!
