<!-- PLANNING -->

- REST implementation of an entity that has at least ADD and REMOVE -> CAR!
- Add costraint checks in servlets 
- Database functions
- On update cascade and on delete cascade (something like that)
- Add Admin and manage relation
- Write into the repo that Card is not integreated into the database yet because there are some problems about
	user ownership!
