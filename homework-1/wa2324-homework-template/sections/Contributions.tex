	\item[Francesco Chemello
] played a pivotal role in our group project, contributing extensively across various domains. He led the development of essential components such as the Car DAO, Card DAO, Rental Transaction DAO, Search DAO, Expired License DAO, Expired Reservation DAO, and Undo Reservation DAO. In addition to these backend implementations, Francesco spearheaded the creation of service layers, encompassing functionalities related to Car, Card, Rental Transaction, and Reserve Services. His expertise also extended to servlet implementations, where he meticulously handled all aspects concerning Car, Card, and Rental Transaction functionalities. On the database front, Francesco contributed significantly by designing the ER schema and ensuring thorough documentation by adjusting code for JavaDoc generation. Furthermore, he undertook crucial code maintenance tasks, addressing issues in files like BasicDAO, Actions, Abstract Database Servlet, Web.xml, and Maven Configuration/POM. To guarantee seamless integration, Francesco conducted comprehensive testing using Maven to validate the code's packaging and functionality within our project framework.
	\item[Elnaz Dolati]As a crucial member of our team, I played a pivotal role in shaping the foundation and functionality of our project. I took the lead in setting up the initial project structure, ensuring it was conducive to smooth development and collaboration. Additionally, I focused on building a secure authentication system to safeguard our project's integrity. In terms of documentation, I made significant contributions to the project report, particularly in detailing the CAR REST APIs, where I provided thorough insights and explanations.
	\item[Gabriella Ingridy De Souza Farias
	] Contribution on ER schema, tables and insert SQL, some code of Reserve and the functionality SearchByUser.
	\item[Luca Pellegrini
]I developed all the REST API: CreateCar, DeleteCar, GetCar and ListCar creating and modifying the related DAO and servlets. I contributed to the integration of the database into the web application making necessary modifications to both the database structure and the web application code.
	\item[Seyedreza Safavi
] played a pivotal role in our project, ensuring robust database connectivity and functionality. He enabled database connection via a context.xml file and developed essential login and register servlets and DAOs, rigorously tested with sample data. Additionally, Reza implemented edit DAOs and servlets for user and license information updates, enhancing project flexibility. He optimized project performance by modifying key classes like User, License, LogContext, and Message. Notably, Reza streamlined data management by implementing a database function to write simultaneously to customer and license tables. He also created all necessary JSPs, facilitating data reception, database interaction, result display, and seamless navigation. Furthermore, Reza modified the web.xml file to effectively connect all servlets and JSPs. He conducted comprehensive testing of Francesco's DAOs and servlets, ensuring compatibility with a simplified database structure. Moreover, he handled exceptions effectively, enhancing the robustness of the application.
	\item[Ahmad Sadin
]was heavily involved in shaping the majority of the report's content. He took the lead in defining key functionalities, crafting the ER-schema, outlining objectives, establishing the data logic layer, and developing class and sequence diagrams. Additionally, Ahmad played a vital role in shaping the presentation logic layer, business logic layer, and specifying REST API details. Moreover, he closely collaborated with Seyed Reza on various tasks, including refining JSP files and implementing user servlets and DAOs. These combined efforts under Ahmad's guidance ensured the successful completion of the project and the achievement of its objectives.
