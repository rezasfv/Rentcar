\textbf{2. Enhanced Customer Management:} Create a comprehensive platform for managing customer information, reservations, and communication channels. This entails facilitating seamless reservation processes for customers, enabling them to make and modify bookings effortlessly, and providing avenues for direct communication between staff and customers to address inquiries and resolve issues promptly.\\

\textbf{3. Streamlined Reservation Handling:} Implement an efficient reservation handling system that allows customers to make and modify reservations seamlessly. Staff members should be equipped with tools to review and manage reservations, ensuring efficient allocation of vehicles based on availability and customer preferences.\\

\textbf{4. Automated Billing and Invoicing: }Develop automated billing processes to generate invoices for reservations and additional services. This includes tracking payments, managing late fees, and generating financial reports for analysis and reconciliation.\\

\textbf{5. Effective Inventory Management:} Establish a centralized system for monitoring vehicle availability and generating alerts for low stock levels. The objective is to ensure that the right cars are available at the right time and location to meet customer demand, thereby optimizing inventory control and maximizing revenue potential.\\
